# Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Project Overview
In this  project, we will create decision functions that attempt to predict survival outcomes from the 1912 Titanic disaster based on each passenger's features, such as sex and age. we will start with a simple algorithm and increase its complexity until we are able to accurately predict the outcomes for at least 80% of the passengers in the provided data. This project will introduce we to some of the concepts of machine learning as we start the Nanodegree program.

In addition, we'll make sure Python is installed with the necessary packages to complete this project. There are two Python libraries, `numpy` and `pandas`, that we'll use a bit here in this project. Don't worry about how these libraries work for now -- we'll get to them in more detail in later projects. This project will also familiarize we with the submission process for the projects that we will be completing as part of the Nanodegree program.

# Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

we will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If we do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that we install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that we select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

If we already have Python 2.7 installed on wer computer, then we can install `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as "iPython") by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) on the command line. [This page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, we can install all the packages with the following command:

`sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter`

# Starting the Project

This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file where we will be performing wer work on the project.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset. we?ll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder containing the project files, and then use the command `jupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` to open up a browser window or tab to work with wer notebook. Alternatively, we can use the command `jupyter notebook` or `ipython notebook` and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A **README** file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.
